## Title: Predictting  the Price of Airbnb Listing at New York City

### Summary of the Project:
The primary aim of this project is to predict the price of a new listing using the features given in the publicly available Airbnb data as well as other relevant features extracted from publicly available datasets. The results of the project benefit all three stakeholders including Airbnb, hosts and guests. Airbnb enables to recommend an appropriate price estimation for the hosts and therefore increase its revenue by increasing the number of hosts that use Airbnb’s service. On the other hand, the price estimation can save hosts’ time and effort to setup listing price. More importantly, if the estimated price is released publicly, hosts can attract more guests by adding some discount and gain more money. Guests can also make informed decisions when estimation is public. 

The data is provided by Airbnb. Airbnb is an online marketplace for booking and/or listing lodging, homestay or tourist houses.The data is accessible from the web, Inside Airbnb, and contains information about host, location, room type, price, review and availability. The data contains roughly 50,000 rows and 16 columns.

Once the data was prepared, regression methods such as linear regression, lasso regression, k-nearest neighbor, decision tree and random forest were used to fit the training dataset and then to test for the test dataset, split during data preparation. Then, a method better predicts the listing price was selected as the final model.  The most commonly used python libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, statsmodels were used to explore, prepare, model and test the data. At the end, the code, visual stories and report is delivered.
